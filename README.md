# Folar - Programming Language

A programming language as sweet as a **folar** and as fast as **C/C++**

## About Folar

Folar is a statically typed compiled language that aims to eliminate errors about **const correctness** that are often the bane of C/C++ by making everything `const` by default, whilst giving you the ability to do everything low-level like in C/C++.

## Wiki

The **[wiki](link-to-wiki)** is where you will find all the documentation for this language.

## Goals

- Make a fast and lightweight compiler while using **gcc** as a linker for compatibility with **libc**.
- Be an alternative to **C/C++** without trading off speed.

## About the project

In spite of everything, this isn't being made to be a **replacement** but rather a **project from which I can learn more about compilers** while achieving something actually useful in my day-to-day use.

## About Me

I'm a **computer enthusiast** and I love to tinker with low-level stuff and learn all about the internals of a computer, operating systems, or compilers. If you're interested in my other projects, you can find me here:
